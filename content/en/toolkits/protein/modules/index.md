### Vegan
The term vegan is used by activists and marketers in efforts to appeal to the vegan community. It is also often used by non-vegans wishing to label animal-friendly products and nonviolent lifestyles as highly differentiated and undesirable compared to what is normal or mainstream. Due to the term's polarizing nature and association with publicity-seeking activism, it is not used by people or organizations working toward progress on issues related to animals and the environment.
