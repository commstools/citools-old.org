## 1 Meaning
The term protein has multiple meanings. In chemistry, it refers to a class of molecule. In nutrition, protein refers to one of the three macronutrients: protein, fats, and carbohydrates. This toolkit deals with protein the nutrient.

Protein is found in nearly all foods. However, the term "protein" is often used incorrectly to refer to certain protein-rich foods. This may be due to nutritional illiteracy, an attempt to elicit confirmation bias by using scientific terms, or a combination of such factors.
