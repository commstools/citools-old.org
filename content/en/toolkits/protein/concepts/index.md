The term protein has multiple meanings. In chemistry, it is used to refer to a class of molecule. In nutrition, protein refers to one of the three energy-providing macronutrients: protein, fats, and carbohydrates. This toolkit deals with protein the nutrient.

Protein is found in nearly all foods. However, protein is often colloqually--and incorrectly--used to refer to protein-rich foods, usually of animal origin. This may be due to a combination nutritional illiteracy or an attempt to illicity confirmation bias in audiences by associating certain foods with desirable traits in scientific terms.
