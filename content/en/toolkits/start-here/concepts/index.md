## Signaling
Refers to indirect methods of communicating a position on a topic, typically by use of language, terminology, tone, source publications, personalities, authors, quotes, and online interaction.

## Framing
Refers to the aggregate context and character of how information is presented.

```Framing communications is like building a house: the location, architecture, materials, windows, doors, colors, quality of construction, etc., all contribute to perception, feeling, and understanding, regardless of what books are on the bookshelf. Similarly, publication, author, affiliations, language, tone, sources, and style all contribute to how information is received and understood, regardless of the information itself.```

## Neutrality
A rigorous approach to neutrality means diligent implementation of communications standards and careful monitoring of communications outputs. In modern information environments, incentives to compromise are constant, and seemingly small compromises add up. 

```Example: A blog article uses mostly scientific publications as references, but includes one or two links to news articles from activist or highly partisan publications. The editor allows it to pass since they are only concerned with the raw information, not how it is framed or presented.

In modern, high-choice information environments, this kind of decision, whether intentional or unwitting, provides implicit endorsement of all sources. 
```

## Revealed intent
Refers to the objective or target audience revealed by communications decisions, which may be at odds with a stated objective.

When the revealed intent is significantly different from the communicator's stated aim,
```
Example: An organization states its mission is to mainstream the adoption of a potentially revolutionary but controversial new technology, but in practice, engages in communications that contribute to polarization and alienate mainstream audiences. This may be due to social incentives of team members seeking recognition in their own community. This is an example of revealed priorities—in this case, pursuing recognition in their community, even at the cost of progress for their stated objectives. 
```
```
Example: an organization states a goal of influencing policy, but in practice amplifies voices online that add political risk and make its topics more difficult for policy makers to approach.
```

## Political risk

## Principles vs. standards
Rules are for people who don’t understand principles. 

## Public-facing
The guides presented on citools are intended to be used in any situation where **how** inforamtion is communicated matters. That is always the case for public-facing communications, as well as with official internal organizational communications. It may or may not be the case for private conversations among individuals or small groups.
