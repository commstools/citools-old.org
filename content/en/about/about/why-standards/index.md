People are the most important asset of any organization. The ideas, perspectives, skills, and talents of unique individuals—and the teams they form—are the sources of all organizational value and progress. But organizations and business entities are also fundamentally different from the individuals and teams that represent them.

In particular, organizations are defined by missions, standards, and structures. They may also have commitments to the public or specific groups to which they are responsible. Individual team members, on the other hand, can be far more varied and dynamic.

In the past, organizational communications were primarily managed by PR departments, agencies, or designated team members. However, in modern online media, social media, and collaborative information environments, every individual may easily become a public-facing representative of their organization—sometimes even unintentionally.

In such a context, organizations that fail to implement communications standards open themselves, and the success of their objectives, to increased risk.

This document is not intended to replace the good judgement of team members. On the contrary, it assumes a high level of commitment, competence, and ability to be guided by strategic principles—not merely follow rules. But it also recognizes the modern challenges of organizational communications and positioning. The solution is simple: communications standards and a mechanism to ensure their implementation.
