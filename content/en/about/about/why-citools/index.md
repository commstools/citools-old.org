### Individuals, teams, and organizations
People are the most important asset of any organization. The ideas, perspectives, skills, and talents of unique individuals are the source of all organizational value. But organizations and business entities are fundamentally different from the teams and individuals that form them:

Organizations are defined by missions, standards, and structures; they may also have commitments to the public or specific groups to which they are responsible.

Individual team members, on the other hand, can be far more varied and dynamic.

### Modern challenges
In the past, organizational communications were primarily managed by PR departments, agencies, or designated team members. However, in modern online media, social media, and collaborative information environments, every individual may easily become a public-facing representative of their organization—sometimes even unintentionally. Team members are also more empowered to impact organizational positioning according to their own incentives, values, and priorities.

In this context, organizations that fail to implement communication standards open themselves, and the success of their objectives, to increased risk.

### The solution is standards
CITools provides well-defined standards and a mechanism to ensure their implementation. 

The resources on CITools are not intended to replace the good judgement of team members. On the contrary, they assume a high level of commitment, competence, and ability to be guided by strategic principles—not merely follow rules.

This enables organizations of all kinds to quickly and easily optimize commuications outputs, reduce risk, and contribute to a better web.
