### Modern challenges

Access to large-scale communications infrastructure used to be costly. For most of the past century, launching a print or broadcast media outlet required significant investments in physical and human capital. Only those with substantial financial resources could reach geographically diverse audiences. Print space was limted. Air time was scarce. This scarcity also meant companies and organizations often needed to spend large sums on traditional advertising in order to communicate with the public. Editorial coverage was like striking gold, hence the old adage "there's no such thing as bad publicity."

The high capital requirements involved in mass communications also incentivized moderation of partisanship and potentially problematic messaging. Print and brodcast media outlets needed qualified team members to enforce editorial standards that would capture the largest audiences, while balancing the interests of investors, advertisers, and regulators. Similarly, businessees, organizatinos, and political entities were incentivized to optimze communications for broad impact and minimize risk of wasted or inefficient efforts.

Today, there are viturally no barriers to entry. Anyone with a laptop or smartphone can communicate with the world. Anyone with an idea can launch a company or organization and reach millions with little or no capital.

Access to information and education has expanded to new levels. 

Liberation of communication has disincentivized such moderation and enabled fringe and extreme communications. This means more brilliance 

But at the same time, so has access to misinformation, that threaten to erode the insitutions that enable social stability and societal progress.

There are also fewer incentives to reduce partisanship in editorial and organizational communications. On the contrary, in modern online media, social media, and collaborative information environments, polarizing messaging is rewarded. 

Reaching a large audience also demanded careful consideration in order balance the interests of investors, advertisers, regulators, and consumers. That meant moderating partisanship 

PR departments, specialized agencies, or designated team members used to be solely responsible for 

Lasse faire embracing of a marketplace of ideas with faith that the best ones will win. This type of faith-based position, though cannot be disproved, is high risk and often a cop out for a failure to think critically or prioritize things over social incentivies. 

### Individuals, teams, and organizations

In the past, technological and structural barriers meant 

In the past, organizational communications were primarily managed by PR departments, agencies, or designated team members. However, in modern online media, social media, and collaborative information environments, every individual may easily become a public-facing representative of their organization—sometimes even unintentionally. Team members are also more empowered to impact organizational positioning according to their own incentives, values, and priorities.

In this context, organizations that fail to implement communication standards open themselves, and the success of their objectives, to increased risk.

People are the most important asset of any organization. The ideas, perspectives, skills, and talents of unique individuals are the source of all organizational value. But organizations and business entities are fundamentally different from the teams and individuals that form them:

Organizations are defined by missions, standards, and structures; they may also have commitments to the public or specific groups to which they are responsible.

Individual team members, on the other hand, can be far more varied and dynamic.



### The solution is standards
CITools provides well-defined standards and a mechanism to ensure their implementation. 

The resources on CITools are not intended to replace the good judgement of team members. On the contrary, they assume a high level of commitment, competence, and ability to be guided by strategic principles—not merely follow rules.

This enables organizations of all kinds to quickly and easily optimize commuications outputs, reduce risk, and contribute to a better web.



 Today, anyone with a laptop or smartphone can communicate with the world. 

Capital requirements and other barriers to entry meant launching a print publication or broadcast media outlet was difficult.  

Today, there are virtually no barriers to entry to keep anyone from communicating with the world. This leveling of the field has been wonderful for . While it holds the potential for fostering a more meritocratic information environment, it also the potential to spread dangerous beliefs, ideologies, and behaviors that threaten public health, social stability, and planetary survival.
