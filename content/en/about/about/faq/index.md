### What are some examples of low CI activities:
1. A politician claims to promote peace, but utilizes rhetoric and messaging that encourages conflict
2. A company or organization states its mission is to improve sustainability of an industry, but in practice utilizes community-specific messaging that alienates mainstream audiences
3. An online influencer claims to champion a particular cause, but in practice uses it to promote his or her own interests


### How does communication integrity get compromised?
Communication integrity can be compromised in more than one way:

* disingenuous intent of the communicator
* social or commercial pressues or incentives
* lack of expertise on a message's subject matter
* failure of organizations to define and implement communications standards

In many cases, low CI messaging is due to a combination of these factors.
