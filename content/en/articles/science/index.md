Notes for a new toolkit for science communication and communication about science.

Scientific literacy doesn't mean simply getting a degree and learning to apply some scientific tools and techniquies in one's work. It means understanding the principles and concepts that make those tools scientific and being able to apply them in more general contexts.

Preamble
Science is a tool. But it has also become a philosophical paradigm and social movement. Confounding usages is one of the most common failures in communications about science-related topics.

In the past, adopting a scientific understanding of the world simply meant accepting the existence of natural, as opposed to supernatural, explainations. In modern information and communication environments, this is no longer sufficient.

Today, the existence of natural explanations is already widely accepted.

Today, the foundational requirement for achieving basic scientific literacy--understanding science as a tool, rather than just a social movement--is understandin that truth is not determined by hierarchy or popular consensus. By that measure, most people, including most scientists, fail the test.

It's important to acknowledge that science as social movement has played an important role in advancing science as a tool by bringing more talent and incentivizing progress in scientific thinking. 

The problem with social movements and philosophical paradigms is that they have a tendency to return to their roots in tribalism and religious psychologies.

In order to maintain basic integrity of the meaning of science as a tool, it has become necessary to reject usages that refer to social movements or philosophies that ignore or invert foundational principles of science the tool. One approach to doing so is to adopt and encourage communications standards, such as those on citools.org. Another approach is to qualify the term in order to differentiate the tool from the social movement, as is done by rational science.

The pillars of science--logic and evidence
The scientific method combines logic and evidence into an effective tool for understanding the mechanisms of natural phenomenea. A scientific understanding of any topic 

Evidnece is abundant, logic is in short supply
